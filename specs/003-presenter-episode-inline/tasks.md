## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Form Reset Functionality (P3) [US3]

**Goal**: Add form clear/reset capability
**Independent Test**: Click "クリア" button → all fields cleared
**Priority**: P3 (Convenience)

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] T054 Final Biome formatting on entire codebase
- [ ] T055 Create PR with comprehensive description and testing notes

## Dependencies

### User Story Dependencies
```
US1 (P1) → Independent (MVP)
US2 (P2) → Depends on US1 (enhances existing form)
US3 (P3) → Depends on US1 (adds to existing form)
```

### Technical Dependencies
```
Foundational Phase → Required by all user stories
Repository method → Required by use case (T012 → T013)
Use case → Required by server action (T013 → T015)
Server action → Required by hook (T015 → T016)
Hook → Required by component (T016 → T018)
```

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Setup) - All tasks can run in parallel
```bash
T003 & T004 & T005 & T006  # Create all placeholder files simultaneously
```

### Phase 2 (Foundational) - Type definitions in parallel
```bash
T007 & T008  # Define input/output types simultaneously
```

### Phase 3 (US1) - Test writing in parallel with implementation
```bash
T013 & T014  # Write use case and its tests simultaneously
T016 & T017  # Write hook and its tests simultaneously
T018 & T022  # Write component and its tests simultaneously
```

### Phase 4 (US2) - UI enhancements in parallel
```bash
T029 & T030  # Add all character counters simultaneously
```

### Phase 5 (US3) - Minimal parallelization
Sequential implementation due to simple scope

### Phase 6 (Polish) - Documentation and testing in parallel
```bash
T045 & T046 & T047  # Deprecate old components simultaneously
T049 & T050  # Run different test suites in parallel
```
